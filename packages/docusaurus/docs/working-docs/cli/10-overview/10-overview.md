# Tool Description

nqmvul is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation tool designed for enhancing the security posture of your software projects. At its core, nqmvul streamlines the process of generating, analysing, and managing SBOMs across various filesystems. Leveraging tools like Syft, Grype, and CCS scanner, nqmvul offers comprehensive vulnerability analysis, providing critical insights into potential security risks within software dependencies.

This tool offers actionable intelligence that enables teams to identify, understand, and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

## Features
Comprehensive SBOM Generation: Generate detailed SBOMs for a variety of filesystems. Understand the composition of your software at a granular level.

### In-depth Vulnerability Analysis: 
Utilise integrated tools like Syft, Grype, and CCS scanner to conduct thorough vulnerability assessments. Gain insights into vulnerabilities associated with your software components.

### Command Suite: 
Whether you need to analyse a single component with -getCpes or generate a comprehensive report with -generateCCPPReport, nqmvul offers a wide range of commands to cater to different aspects of SBOM and vulnerability management. These commands range from generating SBOMs to mapping CPES and classifying CWEs.

### Historical Data Access:
Access historical data on CPES and CVEs, providing a broader context for understanding how vulnerabilities evolve over time. This feature is invaluable for assessing the long-term security implications of specific components or vulnerabilities.

### CWE and GHSA Information:
Retrieve detailed information on Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and GitHub Security Advisories (GHSAs), further enriching the analysis and ensuring a more informed decision-making process regarding security vulnerabilities.
