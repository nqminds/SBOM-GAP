This project leverages several open-source tools and APIs, contributing significantly to its functionality and effectiveness. We extend our sincere thanks to the developers and maintainers of these resources.

## Tools

### Syft: 
* A powerful CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anchore/syft/tree/main)

### Grype: 
* A vulnerability scanner for container images and filesystems, offering an easy and accessible way to find vulnerabilities in your projects. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/anchore/grype/blob/main/README.md)

### CCScanner:
* Is an advanced tool focused on unraveling and managing the intricacies of Third-Party Library (TPL) dependencies within the C/C++ ecosystem, a domain previously less explored due to the absence of a unified package manager. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lkpsg/ccscanner). [Read the Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02575)

### CENTRIS:
* Presents a precise and scalable methodology for identifying the reuse of modified open-source software (OSS), addressing the challenges of vulnerability propagation and license violation inherent in unmanaged OSS components. [Read the Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06182)

## APIs

### Nist Vulnerabilities API:
* Provides access to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a comprehensive repository of vulnerability management data. [API Documentation](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities)

### Nist Products API: 
* Allows querying of product information to assist in understanding the impact of vulnerabilities. [API Documentation](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/products)

The use of these tools and APIs has been instrumental in the development of our project. We are grateful for the support and contributions of the open-source community.
