## Prerequisites

Before installing the SBOM-GAP tool, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

* Node.js: Version `16.16.0` or newer. SBOM-GAP relies on Node.js to run. You can check your current Node version by running `node --version` in your terminal.
npm (Node Package Manager): Version `8.7.0` or newer, which usually comes with Node.js. Verify your npm version with `npm --version`.

* Docker: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is required for running certain services that SBOM-GAP depends on.
* Docker Compose: [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is used for managing multi-container Docker applications.
